My name is Azizur Rahman(Ayan) and I am currently a senior pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in CSE.
 I currently maintain a 3.50 G.P.A and I will be graduating in dec 2021. As a transfer student,
  I have attended Chicago State University for two years,
   where I have been able to find opportunities that have and will continue to help me gain knowledge and advance my accounting career. As a student at CSU,
    I have received two significant awards.  I received E.Q.U.I.P.P.’s Lela E.
     Wright Scholarship and was recognized by Chicago State University for outstanding academic achievement.
      As a College of Business student, I have been selected to participate in Thurgood Marshall College Fund’s 17th Annual
       Leadership Institute this October. While attending Chicago State I have been fortunate enough to 
       work in the Office of Budget and Resource Planning where I am gaining a great deal of experience and
        knowledge pertaining to accounting from my colleagues. I have also been able to network with other
         accounting and finance professionals from whom I am also gaining great knowledge. Obtaining my Bachelor’s 
         degree from Chicago State University is only going to open more doors of opportunity for me as I aspire to work 
         for the Internal Revenue Service as an auditor.
